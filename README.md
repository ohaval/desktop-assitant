# Desktop Assitant

A python GUI app to automate the repetitive actions, and make your work easier, faster
and enjoyable.

## Features

- Data processing and requests making.  
- Auto detection of marked text and clipboard content for further actions.
- The ability to add functions and actions to the app.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/ohaval/desktop-assitant.git
cd desktop-assitant/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd modules/
```

Create a module file and add your own functions and design, for the Tkinter GUI app to the module file, 
and then run your module file:

```
python <Your module file>
```
Or you can run my written modules from the modules directory. For example:
```
python websites_interaction.py
```

## Future Work:
- Fix the tkinter gui design so it can work on every monitor.
- Try pyqt5
- Make a cleaner and quicker code, and deal with errors.
